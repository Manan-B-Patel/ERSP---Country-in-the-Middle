## Research Goal

Understanding where Internet services are hosted, and how users reach them, has captured the interest of government regulators and others concerned with privacy of data flows. We consider a specific version of this question—citizens visiting their own government’s online services—that arguably merits a higher expectation of protection against foreign surveillance or interference. The goal of our research is to Identify unusual network paths to government websites and determine explanations and factors for those interesting behaviors.
